/** 
 * Tutorial: using comments in your code
 */

// Single line comments start with //. The text in the comment will be ignored by the program itself but can be used to make notes or explain what your code does.

// I'm a single comment, yay !

// Multi-line comments, start with /* and end with */. Note that it's same as the tutorial title on the top, it's a multi-line comment.
